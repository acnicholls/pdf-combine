## reason

A friend asked me if I could write a program that would allow a user to combine scanned pdf pages into single files. This is the result

## v2

Later she asked me if I could split documents into a set of separate pages. along came v2

## v2.0.1

I added DevOps workflows to automatically create releases and a windows installer setup MSI to make it easier for users to add to their machine.

## v2.1 - planned

I fixed a few bugs and cleaned up the split page list user input validation and parsing methods
